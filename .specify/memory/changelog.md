### Summary of added behavior

Tiered every speckit-pro-authored spec artifact into CONTRACT (review-visible) vs
EXHAUST (scaffolding); redirected the three speckit-pro-authored EXHAUST artifacts
(design-concept doc, workflow file, UAT runbook) into `.process/` directories
(`docs/ai/specs/.process/` and `specs/<NNN>/.process/`) with no deletion; added a
repository-root `linguist-generated` collapse rule for `.process/` (plus an
idempotent consumer-side ensure-step that writes the same rule into consuming
projects); aligned the reviewability gate to exclude `.process/` lines from
diff-mode reviewable-LOC accounting; and added a Layer-1 lint guarding that every
collapse rule is scoped to `.process/`. Codex skill counterparts were mirrored
identically. Collapse is generated-only (no `-diff`); relocated artifacts stay
diffable. New-specs-only — no existing spec directory was migrated.
