# Phase Execution for Codex

Codex autopilot orchestration runs in the parent session. Phase work runs in
installed custom subagents through `spawn_agent` and `wait_agent`.

## Contents

- [Canonical Order](#canonical-order) — `PHASES = [...]` + `--from-phase` semantics
- [Agent Mapping](#agent-mapping) — per-phase executor + prompt prefix table
- [Main Execution Loop](#main-execution-loop) — full 11-step per-phase pseudocode
- [Phase 7: Implement](#phase-7-implement) — task decomposition + placeholder replacement + reviewability gate
- [PR Body Generation](#pr-body-generation) — script invocation order pre-PR
- [Coverage Audit](#coverage-audit) — all-phase prefix audit run before/during/on-resume

## Canonical Order

```text
PHASES = [specify, clarify, plan, checklist, tasks, analyze, implement]
```

`--from-phase` changes the first phase to execute, not the required plan
coverage. `update_plan` and `autopilot-state.json` must still contain Phase 0,
all seven SDD phases, and Post before any subagent is spawned.

## Agent Mapping

| Phase | Agent | Prompt prefix |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| Specify | `phase-executor` | `Run $speckit-specify with:` |
| Clarify | `clarify-executor` | `Prepare a Clarify Question Set for:` |
| Plan | `phase-executor` | `Run $speckit-plan with:` |
| Checklist | `checklist-executor` | `Run $speckit-checklist with:` |
| Tasks | `phase-executor` | `Run $speckit-tasks with:` |
| Analyze | `analyze-executor` | `Run $speckit-analyze with:` |
| Implement | `implement-executor` or project implementation agent | Task-specific TDD prompt |

Consensus uses `codebase-analyst`, `spec-context-analyst`, and
`domain-researcher`. `autopilot-fast-helper` is optional and never votes.

## Main Execution Loop

For each pending phase, spawn a subagent, collect the result, validate the
gate, and advance.

```text
for phase in PHASES starting from first_pending:
    0. Re-run the all-phase coverage audit against update_plan and
       autopilot-state.json. If Archive Sweep or any canonical phase family
       is missing, STOP and repair the plan before executing this phase.
    1. update_plan: mark the current phase item as "in_progress"
       and mirror the same status change into autopilot-state.json
    2. Check .specify/extensions.yml for before_<phase> hooks
       → run accepted hooks (non-destructive), skip duplicates
    3. Read the workflow file's prompt(s) for this phase
    4. For EACH prompt in the phase:
       a. Resolve <executor>:
          use the matching installed SpecKit custom agent
       b. spawn_agent the resolved <executor>:
          "Run $speckit-<phase> with: <prompt>"
       c. wait_agent for the summary
       d. update_plan: mark this prompt's item as "completed"
       e. Write the same transition to autopilot-state.json
    5. Run consensus in main session if needed:
       Parse executor's "Unresolved for consensus" section.
       For each item → spawn the category-routed analysts (codebase-analyst,
       spec-context-analyst, domain-researcher) per Rule 7 in parallel via
       spawn_agent → wait_agent on all → apply consensus rules → edit artifacts
       → mark the corresponding Consensus item complete in both stores
    6. Check .specify/extensions.yml for after_<phase> hooks
       → run accepted hooks (non-destructive), skip duplicates
    7. Validate gate directly in the main session:
       Run '<SKILL_SCRIPTS>/validate-gate.sh' for gate G<N>
       against <feature_dir> from the orchestrator using the
       resolved scripts path for this skill.
       Parse the script output for PASS/FAIL status.
    8. If gate fails:
       a. Attempt auto-fix (max 2 attempts)
       b. If still failing and gate-failure == "stop": STOP
       c. If gate-failure == "skip-and-log": log, continue
    9. Update workflow file with results and print the current checklist summary
   10. If auto-commit == "per-phase":
       For phases 1–6: run: git add specs/ && git commit
       For phase 7 (implement): run: git add -A && git commit
       (implementation changes include src/, tests/, etc.)
   11. Advance to next phase (next iteration of loop) and write the new
       in_progress item to both update_plan and autopilot-state.json.
       Never mark the run complete while a later phase family still has
       pending items.
```

After all 7 phases complete, proceed to the post-implementation parallel
group (see [post-implementation-codex.md](./post-implementation-codex.md)).

## Phase 7: Implement

Before `tasks.md` exists, the plan contains:

```text
Phase 7: Implement - Pending task decomposition
```

After Tasks completes, replace that placeholder with concrete task-group items
from `tasks.md`. Each implement item must include the task IDs, dependencies,
TDD protocol, `PROJECT_COMMANDS`, and `COMPLETED_TASKS` context accumulated from
earlier work.

After G5 passes, the placeholder is invalid. Before Analyze or Implement can
run, audit `update_plan` and `autopilot-state.json`, then run the
reviewability task gate:

```text
skills/speckit-autopilot/scripts/reviewability-gate.sh tasks specs/<feature>
```

If the gate returns `block` without a ratified split exception, stop before
implementation and split the spec.

- no `Phase 7: Implement - Pending task decomposition` item remains
- one or more concrete `Phase 7:` items exist
- each concrete item names one or more task IDs parsed from `tasks.md`

If any check fails, repair both state stores and print the corrected checklist
summary before continuing.

Use `implement-executor` for test and implementation tasks unless Step 0.11
found a more specific project implementation agent. The parent session dispatches
all workers directly; subagents do not spawn nested agents.

## PR Body Generation

Before creating or updating a PR after G7, the parent session runs:

```text
skills/speckit-autopilot/scripts/reviewability-gate.sh diff origin/main...HEAD
skills/speckit-autopilot/scripts/generate-pr-body.sh "$PWD" specs/<feature> .git/speckit-pr-body.md origin/main...HEAD
```

`generate-pr-body.sh` uses the host repository's pull request template if it
exists, preserves unknown host-required sections, appends missing review-packet
sections, and falls back to the bundled template when the host has none. Use
`gh pr create --body-file .git/speckit-pr-body.md`, not an inline placeholder.

## Coverage Audit

Run the all-phase coverage audit before Phase 1, after every phase transition,
and on resume. If any of these prefixes is absent from either durable state
store, repair the plan before continuing:

```text
Phase 0:
Phase 1:
Phase 2:
Phase 3:
Phase 4:
Phase 5:
Phase 6:
Phase 7:
Post:
```
