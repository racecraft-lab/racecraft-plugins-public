# Phase Execution for Codex

Codex autopilot orchestration runs in the parent session. Phase work runs in
installed custom subagents through `spawn_agent` and `wait_agent`.

## Canonical Order

```text
PHASES = [specify, clarify, plan, checklist, tasks, analyze, implement]
```

`--from-phase` changes the first phase to execute, not the required plan
coverage. `update_plan` and `autopilot-state.json` must still contain Phase 0,
all seven SDD phases, and Post before any subagent is spawned.

## Agent Mapping

| Phase | Agent | Prompt prefix |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| Specify | `phase-executor` | `Run $speckit-specify with:` |
| Clarify | `clarify-executor` | `Prepare a Clarify Question Set for:` |
| Plan | `phase-executor` | `Run $speckit-plan with:` |
| Checklist | `checklist-executor` | `Run $speckit-checklist with:` |
| Tasks | `phase-executor` | `Run $speckit-tasks with:` |
| Analyze | `analyze-executor` | `Run $speckit-analyze with:` |
| Implement | `implement-executor` or project implementation agent | Task-specific TDD prompt |

Consensus uses `codebase-analyst`, `spec-context-analyst`, and
`domain-researcher`. `autopilot-fast-helper` is optional and never votes.

## Phase 7: Implement

Before `tasks.md` exists, the plan contains:

```text
Phase 7: Implement - Pending task decomposition
```

After Tasks completes, replace that placeholder with concrete task-group items
from `tasks.md`. Each implement item must include the task IDs, dependencies,
TDD protocol, `PROJECT_COMMANDS`, and `COMPLETED_TASKS` context accumulated from
earlier work.

After G5 passes, the placeholder is invalid. Before Analyze or Implement can
run, audit `update_plan` and `autopilot-state.json`:

- no `Phase 7: Implement - Pending task decomposition` item remains
- one or more concrete `Phase 7:` items exist
- each concrete item names one or more task IDs parsed from `tasks.md`

If any check fails, repair both state stores and print the corrected checklist
summary before continuing.

Use `implement-executor` for test and implementation tasks unless Step 0.11
found a more specific project implementation agent. The parent session dispatches
all workers directly; subagents do not spawn nested agents.

## Coverage Audit

Run the all-phase coverage audit before Phase 1, after every phase transition,
and on resume. If any of these prefixes is absent from either durable state
store, repair the plan before continuing:

```text
Phase 0:
Phase 1:
Phase 2:
Phase 3:
Phase 4:
Phase 5:
Phase 6:
Phase 7:
Post:
```
